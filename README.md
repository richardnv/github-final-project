# github-final-project

I was recently hired as a developer in a micro-finance startup <br>
with a mission to empower and provide opportunities for low income individuals.<br>
The core team currently uses Subversion (SVN) for managing code. <br>
They want to slowly move their code to Git. <br><br>
I was asked to host their sample code to calculate simple interest on GitHub in <br>
a new repository as the first step in this journey. <br>

I will not only host the script, but also follow best practices introduced in this <br>
course and create supporting documents for the open source project including a <br>
code of conduct, and contribution guidelines.<br>
Additionally, the repository should be available to the community under the Apache License 2.0.
